# lower - UPPER

What if there was a tool that could instantly transform to and from lower- uppercase. Well there is and it's called lower - UPPER, never again your hands will hurt from clicking/holding capslock/shift.

## Getting Started

This is very important, just double click on the file index.html and everything should work. If it's not working ur OS is corrupt and u need to reinstall it.

### Installing

```
The dev environment is private for obvious reasons.
```

## Running tests

Tests are for people that cant code, so none are included in this project.
